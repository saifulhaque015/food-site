                <h3>Fried Rice</h3>
                <p>
                    Any kind of white or brown rice will do. Just be sure that it is cooked (I always cook mine in this
                    rice cooker, which
                    works like a charm) and thoroughly chilled (in a sealed container in the refrigerator) before adding
                    it to your hot
                    skillet. Again, freshly-cooked rice will not work well in this recipe.

                <h3>Chicken Fry</h3>
                <p>
                    Southern fried chicken, also known simply as fried chicken, is a dish consisting of chicken pieces
                    that have been coated
                    with seasoned flour or batter and pan-fried, deep fried, pressure fried, or air fried. The breading
                    adds a crisp coating
                    or crust to the exterior of the chicken while retaining juices in the meat.

                <h3>Hot Dog</h3>
                <p>
                    A hot dog is a food consisting of a grilled or steamed sausage served in the slit of a partially
                    sliced bun, and much
                    debate has centered around whether or not it can be considered a sandwich; the term can also refer
                    to the sausage
                    itself. The sausage used is a wiener or a frankfurter.
